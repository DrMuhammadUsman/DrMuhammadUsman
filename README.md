## Objective

I am deeply committed to innovation in the field of coating processes. With a robust ability to adapt and learn swiftly, I thrive on exploring pioneering approaches and techniques. My enthusiasm for mathematical research is complemented by a keen interest in interdisciplinary collaboration, enabling me to blend diverse scientific perspectives to address complex challenges effectively.

## Research Background

My research focuses on the intricate dynamics of roll coating, a highly efficient and versatile method for applying a thin film of coating to a substrate using rotating rolls. Traditionally, studies in this area have predominantly dealt with Newtonian fluids. However, in practical applications, the fluids encountered are often non-Newtonian, exhibiting more complex and viscous behaviors. Recognizing this gap, my work is dedicated to the theoretical exploration and mathematical modeling of non-Newtonian fluid flows in various roll coating configurations, including reverse, forward, and roll-over-web processes. This is achieved through the application of lubrication approximation theory and a deep dive into the underlying mechanisms of these coating methods. To date, I have made significant strides in this field, having published three articles and having two additional papers under review in top-tier SCI-indexed journals. I am actively engaged in further research, aiming to enrich the scientific community and enhance the practical understanding of roll coating processes involving complex fluids. These contributions are poised to improve the quality, efficiency, and service life of coated surfaces, marking an important advancement in the roll coating literature.
